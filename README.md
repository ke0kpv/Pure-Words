#Pure-Words

This project is a quick and dirty find words and sort.

Works with wild cards. Places processed output into data/.

run.sh takes arguments of PATH. PATH is the path that .pdf files can be found
for conversion to unique words. Those unique words are counted and then sorted.

Disigned with hotswaping and scallablility in mind, this was written in the
course of a weekend.

Recompilation necessary on parts you wish to rewrite. 

Good luck and as we say in ham radio
